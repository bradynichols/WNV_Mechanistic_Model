This repo is designed to be used with Kain and Bolker 2019. 

Empty folders are one of three types: 
-- need to have data placed in them prior to running the code. Data available as the supplementary material to Kain and Bolker 2019 at: URL HERE is organized in the appropriate folders
        -- trees (phylogenetic tree)
        -- ebird_zip_fresh (the .zip ebird file)
        -- data (all other data)
-- model components
        -- stan (stan model definitions)
-- start empty but get filled as part of the automated workflow when output is saved to disk
    -- ebird_data_dump
    -- ebird_data_for_R
    -- ebird_pieces
    -- ebird_unzip
    -- ebird_zip_dump
    -- saved_fits
    -- saved_matching
